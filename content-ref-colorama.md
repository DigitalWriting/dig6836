## Colorama Library for Python

**Colorama** is a Python library that simplifies the process of adding color and styling to text printed in the terminal or command prompt. It ensures consistent cross-platform support for colored text and background colors, making console output more visually appealing and readable.

### Main Features:

1. **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Provides seamless color support across different operating systems.

2. **Simple API:** Offers an intuitive and easy-to-use API for applying color and style changes to text.

3. **Foreground and Background Colors:** Easily change the color of text and the background to enhance readability.

4. **Text Styles:** Supports various text styles, including bold, italic, underline, and more.

### Example Usage:

```python
from colorama import Fore, Back, Style, init

# Initialize Colorama on Windows systems
init(autoreset=True)

# Print colored and styled text
print(Fore.RED + "This text is red!")
print(Back.GREEN + "This has a green background!")
print(Fore.YELLOW + Back.BLUE + Style.BRIGHT + "Bright yellow text on blue background!")

# Reset to default colors and styles
print(Style.RESET_ALL + "Back to normal text.")
```

In this example, `Fore` sets the foreground color, `Back` sets the background color, and `Style` applies styles. The `init(autoreset=True)` call automatically resets colors and styles after each print statement.

### Another Example:

```python
from colorama import Fore, Back, Style, init

init(autoreset=True)

print(Fore.RED + "Error:" + Style.RESET_ALL + " Something went wrong.")
print(Fore.YELLOW + Back.BLUE + Style.BRIGHT + "Attention:" + Style.RESET_ALL + " Please read this carefully.")
print(Back.GREEN + Style.DIM + "Reminder:" + Style.RESET_ALL + " Your appointment is tomorrow.")
```

In this script, different color and style combinations are used to highlight different aspects of the text. `Style.RESET_ALL` resets to default settings after each message.

Remember to install Colorama using:

```bash
pip install colorama
```

Colorama enhances console output by adding visual appeal and emphasis to text in your scripts or command-line programs.
