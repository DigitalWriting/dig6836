# Conditional Logic Practice Problems

Exercise 1:
Write a program that asks the user to enter their age. Based on the age entered, display the appropriate message:
- If the age is less than 18, display "You are a minor."
- If the age is between 18 and 65 (inclusive), display "You are an adult."
- If the age is greater than 65, display "You are a senior citizen."

Exercise 2:
Create a program that asks the user to enter a number. Determine whether the number is even or odd and display an appropriate message.

Exercise 3:
Write a program that prompts the user to enter a month (1-12) and displays the number of days in that month. Assume that it is not a leap year.
- You can use if statements or create a list of days in each month and access it using the entered month as an index.

Exercise 4:
Create a program that generates a random number between 1 and 10. Ask the user to guess the number. Provide feedback to the user indicating whether their guess is too high, too low, or correct. Continue prompting the user until they guess the correct number.

Exercise 5:
Create a program that simulates a rock-paper-scissors game against the computer. Ask the user to enter their choice (rock, paper, or scissors), generate a random choice for the computer, and determine the winner based on the game rules. Display the result to the user.

Exercise 6:
Write a program that calculates the grade for a student based on their score. The program should prompt the user to enter the score (0-100) and display the corresponding grade:
- If the score is 90 or above, display "A"
- If the score is between 80 and 89 (inclusive), display "B"
- If the score is between 70 and 79 (inclusive), display "C"
- If the score is between 60 and 69 (inclusive), display "D"
- If the score is below 60, display "F"

Exercise 7:
Create a program that checks whether a given year is a leap year. Leap years are divisible by 4, but not divisible by 100, unless they are divisible by 400. Prompt the user to enter a year and display whether it is a leap year or not.

Exercise 8:
Write a program that asks the user to enter three numbers and determines the largest of the three. Display the result to the user.

Exercise 9:
Create a program that checks whether a given word is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word that reads the same forwards and backwards. Prompt the user to enter a word and display whether it is a palindrome or not.

Exercise 10:
Write a program that simulates a simple quiz. Ask the user a question and provide multiple-choice options. Based on the user's answer, display whether they answered correctly or incorrectly.
