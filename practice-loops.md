# Looping Practice Problems

**Exercise 1: Countdown Timer**
Write a program that prompts the user to enter a number and then counts down from that number to 0, printing each number on a new line. Use a `while` loop to implement the countdown.

Documentation: [while statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-while-statement)

Example output:

```
Enter a number: 5
5
4
3
2
1
0
```

**Exercise 2: Pattern Printing**
Write a program that asks the user to enter a number and prints a pattern of asterisks (*) in the shape of a right triangle. The number entered by the user will determine the height of the triangle.

Documentation: [for statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-for-statement)

Example output:

```
Enter a number: 5
*
**
***
****
*****
```

**Exercise 3: Word Reversal**
Write a program that prompts the user to enter a word and then prints the word in reverse order. Use a `for` loop and the `range()` function to iterate over the characters in reverse order.

Documentation: [range() function](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#range)

Example output:

```
Enter a word: Python
nohtyP
```

**Exercise 4: Leap Year Checker**
Write a program that asks the user to enter a start year and an end year, and then prints all the leap years between them (inclusive). Use a `for` loop and the modulo operator (`%`) to determine if a year is a leap year.

Documentation: [modulo operator](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#binary-arithmetic-operations)

Example output:

```
Enter the start year: 2000
Enter the end year: 2020
2000 is a leap year
2004 is a leap year
2008 is a leap year
...
2016 is a leap year
2020 is a leap year
```

**Exercise 5: Fibonacci Sequence**
Write a program that prompts the user to enter a number and then prints the Fibonacci sequence up to that number. Use a `while` loop and two variables to keep track of the current and previous numbers in the sequence.

Documentation: [while statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-while-statement)

Example output:

```
Enter a number: 20
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13
```

These exercises cover various looping scenarios and provide opportunities to practice different types of loops, including `while` and `for` loops. They also involve the use of iterators and range-based iteration. Have fun practicing your Python skills!
