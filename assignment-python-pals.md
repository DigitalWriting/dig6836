## Python Pals - Getting to Know Each Other with Code!

### Assignment Description:
In this assignment, you will use the Python programming language to create a simple interactive game that helps you get to know your fellow classmates. You will implement a series of questions about themselves and their hobbies, and the program will display the answers in an engaging way. Let's dive in and have some fun with Python!

### Requirements:
1. Write a Python program that asks the user to input their name and favorite hobby.
2. Display a personalized message that includes the user's name and hobby.
3. Ask at least two more creative questions to gather additional information (e.g., favorite movie, dream travel destination, etc.).
4. Store the answers in variables.
5. Display a summary of the user's answers at the end.

### Example Output:
```

### Tips:
- Use the `input()` function to get user input.
- Store the user's answers in separate variables to display them later.
- Pay attention to formatting and make the output visually appealing.

### Submission Instructions:
Upload your Python code file (.py) to the class portal or email it to your instructor.

### Recommended Development Environment:
I recommend using **Thonny** as your Python Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for this assignment. Thonny provides a beginner-friendly interface and useful features for writing, running, and debugging Python code effectively.

1. Launch Thonny on your computer.
2. Click on "File" > "New" to create a new Python file.
3. Write your Python code in the Thonny editor, utilizing Thonny's features like syntax highlighting and code autocompletion.
4. Test and debug your code by clicking on the "Run" button or using the "F5" keyboard shortcut. Thonny will execute the program and display the output in the shell pane.
5. Make iterative changes, use Thonny's debugging tools, and fix any issues or bugs in your code.
6. Save your Python code using a meaningful file name with the ".py" extension (e.g., "python_pals.py").
7. Submit your Python code file according to the provided submission instructions.
