### How `print()` Works with F-Strings

F-strings, also known as "formatted string literals," are a powerful feature introduced in Python 3.6 that allows you to embed expressions inside string literals, making it easier to format and display values within strings. When using f-strings in combination with the `print()` function, you can create dynamic and well-formatted output.

The syntax for creating an f-string is to prefix a string literal with the letter `f` or `F`, and then enclose the expressions you want to include inside curly braces `{}`.

Here's how the `print()` function works with f-strings:

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 30

# Using f-strings to format and print variables
print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")

# You can also perform calculations within f-strings
x = 10
y = 20
print(f"The sum of {x} and {y} is {x + y}.")
```

In this example, the expressions within the curly braces are evaluated, and their values are inserted into the string at those positions. This makes it easy to incorporate variables, calculations, and even function calls directly into your string output.

F-strings can also have formatting specifications within the curly braces to control how values are presented. For example:

```python
pi = 3.141592653589793

# Formatting with a specific number of decimal places
print(f"The value of pi is approximately {pi:.2f}")

# Specifying the width and alignment of values
number = 42
print(f"The number is: {number:5d}")  # Output: "The number is:    42"

# Aligning values to the left
word = "Python"
print(f"Left aligned: {word:<10}")    # Output: "Left aligned: Python    "
```

F-strings are a convenient way to create readable and expressive output, as they allow you to directly embed variable values and expressions within your string content. They are especially helpful when you need to generate complex strings with dynamic content without having to concatenate strings and values manually.
