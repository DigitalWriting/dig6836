# Fandom Frenzy (With Functions!)

## Introduction

In this two-week long project, you will explore the exciting world of Python functions while diving deep into your favorite media property or fictional universe. Whether you're a fan of movies, TV shows, books, video games, or any other form of media, this assignment will allow you to combine your passion for your fandom with the power of programming.

## Assignment Overview

Your task is to create a Jupyter notebook on Google CoLab that interacts with the user to gather information about their favorite fandom. You will use functions to handle different aspects of the fandom, such as character information, plot summaries, or any other creative ideas you come up with.

## Requirements

1. The Jupyter notebook should be hosted on Google CoLab.
2. The program should use functions for different functionalities, and each function must have a clear purpose.
3. At least one function should accept arguments to customize its behavior.
4. At least one function should return a value that is displayed to the user.
5. The program should handle input validation to ensure that incorrect data is not accepted.
6. The program should have a user-friendly and engaging interface.

## Suggested Steps

1. Choose your Fandom: Select your favorite fandom or any topic you are passionate about. It could be a movie, TV show, book series, video game, or anything that excites you.

2. Design Functionality: Plan out the different functionalities you want to include in your program. For example, you can have functions for:
   - Displaying a list of characters or elements from your fandom.
   - Providing a plot summary of your favorite movie or TV show.
   - Creating a character generator with customizable traits.
   - Calculating statistics related to your fandom, like the average rating of episodes or books.

3. Implement Functions: Start writing Python functions for each of the functionalities you designed. Remember to use proper function naming and structure.

4. User Interaction: Create a user-friendly interface to interact with your program. Use input() and print() statements to communicate with the user.

5. Input Validation: Implement input validation to ensure the user provides appropriate input.

6. Test Your Program: Thoroughly test your program with various inputs to check if it works as expected and handles different scenarios correctly.

7. Debug and Refine: Review your code for any bugs or improvements that can be made. Optimize your functions and make sure they follow best practices.

8. Documentation: Include comments and/or docstrings to explain the purpose of your functions and how to use them.

9. Jupyter Notebook: Convert your Python code into a Jupyter notebook and host it on Google CoLab.

10. Show Your Unique Voice: Add finishing touches to your program to make it stand out and showcase your creative ideas and original voice.

## Submission

When you have completed the assignment, please submit the following:
- The link to your Jupyter notebook hosted on Google CoLab. 
- Ensure your notebook also contains a brief write-up about your chosen area of fandom and the functionalities you implemented.

## Have Fun!

This assignment is all about exploring the intersection of your passion for your favorite fandom and the world of programming. Feel free to get creative and have fun with it! If you need any help or have any questions, don't hesitate to ask for assistance.
