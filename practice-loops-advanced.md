# Looping Practice Problems (Advanced)

**Exercise 1: Countdown Timer with Animation**
Write a program that prompts the user to enter a number and then counts down from that number to 0, printing each number on a new line. However, add an animated effect by displaying a countdown animation, such as a spinning wheel or a bouncing character, between each number.

Documentation: [while statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-while-statement)

Example output:

```
Enter a number: 3
3
[Display animation]
2
[Display animation]
1
[Display animation]
0
```

**Exercise 2: Pattern Printing with Variable Characters**
Write a program that asks the user to enter a number and a character, and prints a pattern of the given character in the shape of a right triangle. The number entered by the user will determine the height of the triangle.

Documentation: [for statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-for-statement)

Example output:

```
Enter a number: 4
Enter a character: @
@
@@
@@@
@@@@
```

**Exercise 3: Word Reversal with Palindrome Check**
Write a program that prompts the user to enter a word and then prints the word in reverse order. Additionally, check if the reversed word is the same as the original word (a palindrome) and display a message indicating the result.

Documentation: [range() function](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#range)

Example output:

```
Enter a word: radar
Reversed word: radar
It is a palindrome!
```

**Exercise 4: Leap Year Checker with User Input Validation**
Write a program that asks the user to enter a start year and an end year, and then prints all the leap years between them (inclusive). Ensure that the input years are valid (start year should be less than or equal to the end year). If the input is invalid, display an error message and ask the user to enter the years again.

Documentation: [modulo operator](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#binary-arithmetic-operations)

Example output:

```
Enter the start year: 2020
Enter the end year: 1999
Invalid input! Start year should be less than or equal to the end year.
Enter the start year: 2000
Enter the end year: 2020
Leap years between 2000 and 2020 (inclusive):
2000 2004 2008 2012 2016 2020
```

**Exercise 5: Fibonacci Sequence with Customized Output**
Write a program that prompts the user to enter a number and then prints the Fibonacci sequence up to that number. Additionally, display each number in the sequence with an indication of whether it is even or odd.

Documentation: [while statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-while-statement)

Example output:

```
Enter a number: 15
Fibonacci sequence up to 15:
0 (even) 1 (odd) 1 (odd) 2 (even) 3 (odd) 5 (odd) 8 (even) 13 (odd)
```

These advanced exercises build upon the previous ones by incorporating additional features and concepts, such as animations, user input validation, and customized output.
