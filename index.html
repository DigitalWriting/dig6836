    <h2 id="objective">Objective</h2>
    <p>Design a simple, text-based escape room game using variables, loops, and conditional logic. Implement &quot;lock and key&quot; type puzzles where an item obtained from one room is necessary to unlock another room and progress through the game. The game should include at least three rooms and a basic inventory system.</p>
    <h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Create a Python program that simulates a spooky escape room game.</li>
    <li>The game should start by providing a spooky introduction and setting the scene for the players.</li>
    <li>Implement a function for each room in the game, where each function represents a different room.</li>
    <li>Each room function should display a description of the room and provide options for the player to interact with the environment or objects in the room.</li>
    <li>Use variables to keep track of the player&#39;s progress, current room, and the items they have collected in their inventory.</li>
    <li>Use loops and conditional statements to guide the player through the game and handle different scenarios based on their choices.</li>
    <li>Create &quot;lock and key&quot; puzzles where the player needs to find and use specific items to unlock doors or access new areas.</li>
    <li>Include at least three rooms with unique puzzles and challenges. Make sure to design a logical progression, where the player needs to solve puzzles in a specific order to advance.</li>
    <li>Implement a basic inventory system using lists or dictionaries to keep track of the items the player has collected.</li>
    <li>Once the player successfully escapes the final room, display a winning message and end the game.</li>
    </ol>
