# Flask Humanities Showcase

## Introduction
In this assignment, you will explore the Flask library in Python and build a web application called "Flask Humanities Showcase." The application will highlight various aspects of humanities, such as literature, art, philosophy, or history. You will create multiple routes/pages, each representing a different aspect of the humanities, and showcase relevant content.

## Task
Your task is to build the Flask Humanities Showcase web application. Each route/page should focus on a specific theme within the humanities, presenting information, images, or interactive elements related to that theme.

## Instructions

1. **Install Flask**: If you don't have Flask installed, use the following command to install it:
   ```
   pip install flask
   ```

2. **Create a new Python script**: Create a new Python script named `flask_humanities_showcase.py`.

3. **Import the necessary modules**: Import the necessary modules in your Python script:
   ```python
   from flask import Flask, render_template
   ```

4. **Create an instance of the Flask class**: Create an instance of the Flask class in your Python script:
   ```python
   app = Flask(__name__)
   ```

5. **Define multiple routes**: Define multiple routes for your application in your Python script. Each route will represent a different theme within the humanities:
   - Route 1: Home page
     - URL: `/`
     - Description: This page will serve as the landing page for your Flask Humanities Showcase application. It should provide an overview of the application and list the available themes within the humanities.

   - Route 2: Literature
     - URL: `/literature`
     - Description: This page should display information, excerpts, or notable works related to a particular literary theme, author, or literary movement.

   - Route 3: Art
     - URL: `/art`
     - Description: This page should showcase artworks, artists, or art movements that have had a significant impact on the humanities.

   - Route 4: Philosophy
     - URL: `/philosophy`
     - Description: This page should explore philosophical ideas, thinkers, or philosophical movements that have shaped the humanities.

   - Route 5: History
     - URL: `/history`
     - Description: This page should delve into historical events, periods, or figures that have influenced the humanities.

   - Feel free to add more routes/pages for additional themes or aspects within the humanities.

6. **Define view functions**: Define view functions for each route in your Python script. Each view function will render the corresponding HTML template:
   - Create a function for the home page route:
     ```python
     @app.route('/')
     def index():
         themes = ["Literature", "Art", "Philosophy", "History"]  # Update with humanities themes
         return render_template('index.html', themes=themes)
     ```

   - Create view functions for each theme route:
     ```python
     @app.route('/literature')
     def literature():
         # Add code to display content related to Literature
         return render_template('literature.html')

     @app.route('/art')
     def art():
         # Add code to display content related to Art
         return render_template('art.html')

     @app.route('/philosophy')
     def philosophy():
         # Add code to display content related to Philosophy
         return render_template('philosophy.html')

     @app.route('/history')
     def history():
         # Add code to display content related to History
         return render_template('history.html')
     ```

   - Remember to add more view functions for additional themes or aspects within the humanities

.

7. **Create HTML templates**: Create HTML templates for each page in your Flask application. Each template will represent a different page/theme:
   - Create an `index.html` template for the home page.
   - Create separate HTML templates for each theme page (`literature.html`, `art.html`, `philosophy.html`, `history.html`, etc.).

8. **Test your application**: Run your Flask application and test it by navigating to different routes in your web browser.
