## Course Description

Texts & Technology work is situated on an understanding of "new" media mechanisms, which includes the underlying layer of code. Throughout the core Texts & Technology courses, we work to bridge the gaps of text, technology, and theory. In *Humanistic Data Analysis*, we will put this understanding into practice, building towards confidence and flexibility in using procedural tools and digital methods in humanities research. While there are many languages potential relevant to T&T and the digital humanities broadly, this course focuses on Python, which is currently one of the top choices for data analysis thanks to its tools (including Jupyter Notebooks, which we will employ), robust libraries (allowing specialized functionality for dealing with common tasks in data analysis), and flexibility.

The main practical objective of this course is to provide you with the necessary skills to utilize Python and associated tools for conducting research in the humanities. By the end of the course, you will be equipped with the knowledge and practical experience to analyze and interpret data within a humanistic context.

With this goal in mind, the bulk of the course will be spent experimenting. While at first it may seem there is minimal "writing" in this course, Annette Vee's framework reminds us that code itself fits in the rubric of literacy, and through reading and writing code (and using it as a lens for seeing other "texts") we will build that procedural literacy. This may mean stepping out of our comfort zones. As we learn to build interactive programs and web pages in Python, we will remix content, make use of AI tools and other assistive software, experiment with different strategies, fail often, revise our approach, spend significant amounts of time searching and researching, perservere, and ultimately create projects that are useful to our goals. This is what it means to be digitally literate scholars operating in an ever-evolving technological landscape.

At the end of the course, we will put this knowledge to use through developing and presenting a larger project, building upon the exercises towards a potential future research application in an area of interest.

## Course Structure and Minor Assignments

Each week, plan on following instructions in the Webcourses module regarding readings and online exercises to accompany the in-class discussion. Each module will be divided into three sections:

- **Weekly Readings and Lecture.** The full schedule of required readings is listed in the syllabus. Additional recommended readings will be provided in each module. Weekly lectures for this course will be pre-recorded and available online.
- **In-Person Activities.** This course follows the flipped classroom approach: lectures are online, and each week's in-person meeting will involve a combination of hands-on design and review of coding assignments, working through smaller coding exercises, lab collaboration time, and discussions focused on understanding and applying concepts from the readings. 
- **Coding Assignments.** Weekly online assignments and more complex, multi-week projects to build your skills in programming, debugging, and applying code solutions to research and design problems.

---

## Major Assignment

**Final Project.** In addition to smaller, periodic Python projects assigned throughout the semester, you will also complete a larger, more complex assignment, including a proposal, which will allow you to develop a more comprehensive research deliverable in Python related to your research interests.

---

## Student Learning Objectives

- Develop proficiency in Python programming and associated libraries/tools for data analysis in the humanities. This will include an understanding of programming, including basic terminology and the use of variables, functions, loops, libraries, and conditional statements.

- Understand the installation, configuration, syntax, and debugging methods required for Python.
    
- Apply data manipulation techniques to clean, preprocess, and transform diverse datasets commonly encountered in humanities research.
    
- Conduct exploratory data analysis to gain insights into patterns, trends, and distributions within humanities datasets.
    
- Employ text processing and natural language processing techniques to analyze and extract meaningful information from textual data in the humanities.
    
- Utilize web scraping and data collection methods to gather relevant data from online sources for humanities research.
     
- Learn about and apply appropriate programmatic techniques and/or algorithms unique to your individual research question(s) (e.g., geospatial analysis, network analysis, machine learning, topic modeling, time series analysis, text mining, etc.).
        
- Create visually appealing and informative data visualizations for communicating research findings in the humanities.
    
- Demonstrate an understanding of ethical considerations and responsible practices in humanistic data analysis, including privacy, security, and data protection.

- Reflect upon the design of technology, with critical attention to its engagement with theoretical frameworks and the assumptions and dangers of algorithmic methods.
    
- Design and execute an independent research project that applies Python and associated tools to analyze and interpret data within a humanistic context.
    
- Communicate research findings effectively through written reports and oral presentations.

These learning outcomes aim to ensure that students acquire both the technical skills necessary for data analysis in the humanities and a strong understanding of the ethical considerations and research practices relevant to the field.

## General Policies

### COVID-19 Statement for Fall 2023

**Notifications in Case of Changes to Course Modality** If the instructor falls ill during the semester, there may be temporary changes to this course, including having a backup instructor take over the course or going remote for a short time. Please look for announcements or mail in Webcourses@UCF or Knights email for any temporary alterations to this course.

Students should contact their instructor(s) as soon as possible if they miss class for any illness to discuss reasonable adjustments that might need to be made. When possible, students should contact their instructor(s) before missing class.

### Academic Integrity

[The Center for Academic Integrity (CAI)](http://academicintegrity.org/) defines academic integrity as a commitment, even in the face of adversity, to five fundamental values: honesty, trust, fairness, respect, and responsibility. From these values flow principles of behavior that enable academic communities to translate ideals into action.

**UCF Creed:** Integrity, scholarship, community, creativity, and excellence are the core values that guide our conduct, performance, and decisions.

1. Integrity: I will practice and defend academic and personal honesty.
2. Scholarship: I will cherish and honor learning as a fundamental purpose of my membership in the UCF community.
3. Community: I will promote an open and supportive campus environment by respecting the rights and contributions of every individual.
4. Creativity: I will use my talents to enrich the human experience.
5. Excellence: I will strive toward the highest standards of performance in any endeavor I undertake.

Students should familiarize themselves with [UCF’s Rules of Conduct](https://scai.sdes.ucf.edu/student-rules-of-conduct/). According to Section 1, “Academic Misconduct,” students are prohibited from engaging in

1. Unauthorized assistance: Using or attempting to use unauthorized materials, information or study aids in any academic exercise unless specifically authorized by the instructor of record. The unauthorized possession of examination or course-related material also constitutes cheating.
2. Communication to another through written, visual, electronic, or oral means: The presentation of material which has not been studied or learned, but rather was obtained through someone else’s efforts and used as part of an examination, course assignment, or project.
3. Commercial Use of Academic Material: Selling of course material to another person, student, and/or uploading course material to a third-party vendor without authorization or without the express written permission of the university and the instructor. Course materials include but are not limited to class notes, Instructor’s PowerPoints, course syllabi, tests, quizzes, labs, instruction sheets, homework, study guides, handouts, etc.
4. Falsifying or misrepresenting the student’s own academic work.
5. Plagiarism: Using or appropriating another’s work without any indication of the source, thereby attempting to convey the impression that such work is the student’s own.
6. Multiple Submissions: Submitting the same academic work for credit more than once without the express written permission of the instructor.
7. Helping another violate academic behavior standards.
8. Soliciting assistance with academic coursework and/or degree requirements.

### Responses to Academic Dishonesty, Plagiarism, or Cheating

Students should also familiarize themselves with the procedures for academic misconduct in UCF’s student handbook, [The Golden Rule](https://goldenrule.sdes.ucf.edu/). UCF faculty members have a responsibility for students’ education and the value of a UCF degree, and so seek to prevent unethical behavior and respond to academic misconduct when necessary. Penalties for violating rules, policies, and instructions within this course can range from a zero on the exercise to an “F” letter grade in the course. In addition, an Academic Misconduct report could be filed with the Office of Student Conduct, which could lead to disciplinary warning, disciplinary probation, or deferred suspension or separation from the University through suspension, dismissal, or expulsion with the addition of a “Z” designation on one’s transcript.

### Course Accessibility Statement

This course is built with universal design for learning principles in mind: if you encounter challenges with any of the course materials, assignments, platforms, or requirements, please reach out for assistance, and know that additional support is always available regardles of documentation. If changes in course modality occur and you require additional accomodations, please reach out as soon as possible.

Additionally, the University of Central Florida is committed to providing access and inclusion for all persons with disabilities. Students with disabilities who need access to course content due to course design limitations should contact the professor as soon as possible. Students should also connect with [Student Accessibility Services (SAS)](http://sas.sdes.ucf.edu/) (Ferrell Commons 185, sas@ucf.edu, phone 407-823-2371). For students connected with SAS, a Course Accessibility Letter may be created and sent to professors, which informs faculty of potential course access and accommodations that might be necessary and reasonable. Determining reasonable access and accommodations requires consideration of the course design, course learning objectives and the individual academic and course barriers experienced by the student. Further conversation with SAS, faculty and the student may be warranted to ensure an accessible course experience.

### Campus Safety Statement

Emergencies on campus are rare, but if one should arise during class, everyone needs to work together. Students should be aware of their surroundings and familiar with some basic safety and security concepts.

- In case of an emergency, dial 911 for assistance.
- Every UCF classroom contains an emergency procedure guide posted on a wall near the door. Students should make a note of the guide’s physical location and review the [online version](http://emergency.ucf.edu/emergency_guide.html).
- Students should know the evacuation routes from each of their classrooms and have a plan for finding safety in case of an emergency.
- If there is a medical emergency during class, students may need to access a first-aid kit or AED (Automated External Defibrillator). To learn where those are located, see [locations](https://ehs.ucf.edu/automated-external-defibrillator-aed-locations).
- To stay informed about emergency situations, students can sign up to receive UCF text alerts by going to [MyUCF](https://my.ucf.edu) and logging in. Click on “Student Self Service” located on the left side of the screen in the toolbar, scroll down to the blue “Personal Information” heading on the Student Center screen, click on “UCF Alert”, fill out the information, including e-mail address, cell phone number, and cell phone provider, click “Apply” to save the changes, and then click “OK.”
- Students with special needs related to emergency situations should speak with their instructors outside of class.
- To learn about how to manage an active-shooter situation on campus or elsewhere, consider viewing this [video](https://youtu.be/NIKYajEx4pk).

### Deployed Active Duty Military Students

Students who are deployed active duty military and/or National Guard personnel and require accommodation should contact their instructors as soon as possible after the semester begins and/or after they receive notification of deployment to make related arrangements.

### Authorized Events and Religious Observances

Students who represent the university in an authorized event or activity (for example, student-athletes) and who are unable to meet a course deadline due to a conflict with that event must provide the instructor with documentation in advance to arrange a make-up. No penalty will be applied.

Students must notify their instructor in advance if they intend to miss class for a religious observance. For more information, see the [UCF policy](http://regulations.ucf.edu/chapter5/documents/5.020ReligiousObservancesFINALJan19.pdf).
